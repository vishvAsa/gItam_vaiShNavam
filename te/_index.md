The sankeerthanas found in tirupati and at ahobilam matham together are around 2800 or so number of copper plates . Annamayya’s samkeerthanas are around 14,000 but also some by his son pedda tirumalacharya and his grandson even. The claimed 32,000 have never been found. It’s theorized more could be in ahobilam matham . 

Apparently annamayya also wrote a sanskrit Ramayana but this is lost . 

Out of 14,000 only 800 have been published, from which only 200 have been synthesized into popular musicals .
